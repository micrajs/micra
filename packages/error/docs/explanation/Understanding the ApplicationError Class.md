# Understanding the `ApplicationError` Class

## Introduction

The `ApplicationError` class is a cornerstone of the Micra Frameworkâ€™s error management system, designed to provide structured, consistent, and extensible error handling. It aligns with industry standards like **RFC 9457** for structured error reporting, ensuring predictable and interoperable error responses.

## Context

The `ApplicationError` class serves as the primary error type in the Micra Framework. It extends the native JavaScript `Error` object, adding fields and methods that enhance error handling, debugging, and logging.

## Why Use `ApplicationError`?

The `ApplicationError` class provides a consistent structure for all errors, making them easier to handle and log. By using structured errors, developers can rely on predictable error formats, which simplifies debugging and enhances logging. The support for nested errors through the errors array allows complex error scenarios to be represented clearly. Additionally, its toJSON method facilitates serialization for transport and storage, and its extensibility enables developers to create custom error types tailored to their application's needs.

## Key Components of `ApplicationError`

### `detail`

A human-readable explanation of the error. For example, if a user submits an invalid email during registration, the `detail` could be `'Invalid input provided for the email field.'` This helps developers and users quickly understand what went wrong.

### `instance`

A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the error. For instance, if an error occurs while updating user information, `instance` could be `'/api/users/1234'` to point to the exact resource and request that triggered the error.

### `metadata`

Additional contextual information about the error, such as `requestId`, `userId`, or other relevant data. For example, during a failed payment process, `metadata` might include `{ transactionId: 'txn-7890', userId: 5678 }` to assist in tracing the issue.

### `status`

An HTTP status code that represents the error, such as `400` for a bad request or `500` for an internal server error. For example, a missing required field could return a `400` status to indicate a client-side error.

### `title`

A short, human-readable title describing the error. In a login failure scenario, the `title` might be `'Authentication Failed'`, providing a quick summary of the issue.

### `type`

A URI reference that identifies the type of error, often pointing to documentation or a reference page. For example, `'https://example.com/errors/validation-error'` can give developers more context on what the error means and how to resolve it.

## Conclusion

The `ApplicationError` class in the Micra Framework offers a robust and extensible solution for error handling, aligning with modern web standards. By understanding its components, developers can leverage structured errors to improve logging, debugging, and overall error management within their applications.
