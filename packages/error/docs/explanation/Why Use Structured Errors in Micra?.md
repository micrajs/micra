# Why Use Structured Errors in Micra?

## Introduction

Structured errors are essential for maintaining clarity, consistency, and predictability in modern applications. In Micra, structured errors ensure that every error carries vital information in a uniform format, making it easier for developers to log, debug, and handle errors across various parts of an application.

## Context

Micra’s error management system is inspired by HTTP standards like **RFC 9457**, which outlines a format for problem details in HTTP APIs. By aligning with these standards, Micra ensures that its errors are interoperable with modern web technologies.

### **Key Benefits of Structured Errors**

- **Consistency Across the Application:** Every error follows the same structure, making it easier to handle and process errors uniformly.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Structured errors include fields such as `status`, `title`, `detail`, and `metadata`, providing detailed context for debugging.
- **Improved Logging:** Logs become more informative and searchable when errors follow a consistent format.
- **Better API Responses:** APIs can return structured error responses that clients can easily parse and act upon.

### **Alignment with HTTP Standards**

Micra’s error structure mirrors HTTP standards, ensuring that:

- **`status` codes align with HTTP status codes** (e.g., 400 for Bad Request, 500 for Internal Server Error).
- **`title` provides a short summary** of the error.
- **`detail` offers a human-readable explanation**.
- **`instance` identifies the specific occurrence** of the error.
- **`metadata` allows for additional context**, such as request IDs or user details.

This alignment ensures that Micra’s errors integrate seamlessly with web-based systems, particularly REST APIs.

## Conclusion

Structured errors in Micra enhance the developer experience by providing clear, consistent, and detailed information for error handling. By adhering to established HTTP standards, Micra ensures that its errors are not only developer-friendly but also interoperable with the broader web ecosystem. This structure simplifies debugging, enriches logging, and improves API interactions, making error management more reliable and efficient.
