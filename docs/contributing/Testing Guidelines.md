# Testing Guidelines

Comprehensive testing ensures that the framework remains reliable, maintainable, and performant. Follow these guidelines to contribute effectively to testing and quality assurance efforts.

## **1. Writing Tests**

### Guidelines:

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test individual functions or components in isolation.
  - Aim for high coverage of edge cases and expected behaviors.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Verify that multiple components interact correctly.
  - Focus on common workflows and data flows.
- **End-to-End Tests:**
  - Simulate real-world scenarios to validate the framework’s behavior as a whole.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Tests:**
  - Focus on tests that validate meaningful behaviors or user outcomes.
  - Avoid writing tests for trivial code paths unless they are critical.
- **Avoid Over-Coupling to Implementation Details:**
  - Write tests that validate behavior rather than specific internal implementations.
  - Ensure tests remain flexible to accommodate refactoring or internal changes without breaking unnecessarily.

### Tools:

- Use [Vitest](#) for unit and integration tests.
- For E2E testing, use [Playwright](#).

## **2. Contributing Tests**

### Guidelines:

- **Write Clear Assertions:**
  - Ensure tests are easy to understand and maintain.
- **Avoid Flaky Tests:**
  - Ensure tests produce consistent results across runs.
- **Document Your Tests:**
  - Add comments to explain complex scenarios or workflows.

## **3. Continuous Improvement**

- **Monitor Test Coverage:**
  - Identify gaps in coverage and prioritize writing tests for critical areas.
- **Review Existing Tests:**
  - Refactor or enhance outdated tests to align with current practices.
- **Suggest Improvements:**
  - Share feedback on improving testing workflows or tools.
