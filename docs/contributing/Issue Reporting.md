# Issue Reporting

Reporting issues is a vital way to help improve the framework. This document provides guidelines for submitting clear and actionable issue reports.

## **1. Before Submitting an Issue**

### Checklist:

- **Search Existing Issues:**
  - Look for similar issues in the repository to avoid duplicates.
  - If a similar issue exists, consider adding your input to the existing thread.

  - Ensure the issue is reproducible using the latest version of the framework.
- **Gather Information:**
  - Collect relevant details like error messages, logs, and system information.

## **2. Writing an Effective Issue Report**

### Use the GitHub Issue Template:

- Utilize the pre-built [Bug Report Template](#) when creating a new issue on GitHub. This template ensures all relevant details are captured and structured for efficient resolution.
- **Library:**
  - Specify the package or module where the issue occurred (e.g., `@micra/core`, `@micra/application`).
- **What happened?:**
  - Clearly describe the issue and what you expected to happen instead.
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  - Provide step-by-step instructions to replicate the issue.
- **Environment Details:**
  - Include runtime specifics such as:
    - Framework version.
    - Operating system and browser (if applicable).
    - Node.js or runtime version.
- **Additional Information:**
  - Attach logs, screenshots, reproduction videos, or a link to a minimal reproducible example repository.
  - For complex issues, the template encourages sharing a small repository or code snippet to help maintainers reproduce and resolve the problem faster.
  - Share a minimal reproducible example if possible.
- **Code of Conduct:**
  - Confirm your agreement to follow the project’s Code of Conduct by selecting the checkbox.

## **3. Tracking and Resolving Issues**
