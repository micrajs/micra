## **1. Getting Started**

### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Repository:**

   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   - Install dependencies using the package manager specified in the repository.

2. **Understand the Codebase:**

   - Review the project’s README and architecture documentation.
   - Familiarize yourself with the project’s folder structure and dependencies.

3. **Pick an Issue:**
   - Check open issues for tasks labeled `Community: good first issue` or `Community: help wanted`.
   - Discuss your intentions in the issue thread to avoid duplication of effort.

## **2. Development Process**

### Guidelines:

- **Create a Feature Branch:**
  - Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-auth`, `fix/button-styling`).
- **Write Clean Code:**
  - Follow the framework’s coding standards (e.g., linting rules, formatting).
  - Write modular, reusable code that adheres to DRY principles.
- **Add Tests:**
  - Ensure that your changes are covered by unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
- **Document Changes:**
  - Update relevant documentation (e.g., API references, guides).

## **3. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**

### Steps:

1. **Push Your Changes:**
   - Push your feature branch to your forked repository.
2. **Open a PR:**
   - Clearly describe the changes and reference any related issues.
   - Attach screenshots or logs if applicable.
3. **Respond to Feedback:**
   - Engage in the PR review process and address comments promptly.

## **4. Best Practices**

- **Small, Focused Changes:**
  - Limit each PR to a single feature or bug fix.
- **Write Descriptive Commits:**
  - Summarize changes concisely and avoid vague messages like "fixed stuff".
- **Follow Git Standards:**
  - Use meaningful branch names and adhere to the repository’s contribution workflow.
- **Test Thoroughly:**
  - Ensure your changes don’t break existing functionality.
