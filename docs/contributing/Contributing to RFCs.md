# Contributing to RFCs

The RFC (Request for Comments) process enables thoughtful, transparent, and collaborative decision-making for significant changes, particularly in API design and architectural decisions. Here's how you can participate and contribute:

---

## **1. Purpose**

- Provide a structured framework for proposing, discussing, and refining major changes.
- Foster collaboration and alignment with the framework’s goals.

---

## **2. How to Participate**

### Guidelines:

- **Engage Constructively:**
  - Share feedback on open RFCs in a respectful and specific manner.
  - Suggest improvements or raise concerns thoughtfully.
- **Contribute to API Design:**
  - Provide real-world use cases or examples to validate proposed designs.
  - Offer alternative approaches when relevant.
- **Follow Discussions:**
  - Stay updated on ongoing RFCs and participate in discussions where you can add value.

## **3. Submitting an RFC**

### Steps:

1. **Open an Issue:**
   - Submit your RFC as an issue in the repository’s designated section.
   - Use the label `Stage: rfc` to categorize the issue.
2. **Create a Draft API Design PR:**
   - Write your proposal using the RFC template, outlining the problem, goals, and proposed solution.
   - Include API examples, technical trade-offs, and potential risks.
   - Introduce TypeScript interfaces in the `core` package.
3. **Iterate on Feedback:**
   - Incorporate community input and refine your proposal.
4. **Approval Process:**
   - Reach consensus with maintainers and contributors before moving forward.
